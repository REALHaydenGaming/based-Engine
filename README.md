# FNF: based Engine
An brand new redesign of the now buggy "based Engine".

This was made over one message I got from a [Yoshi Crafter developer](https://twitter.com/cap_kirby).

### HOW TO COMPILE
First, make sure you have the latest of ***[polymod](https://lib.haxe.org/p/polymod/1.6.0/releasenotes)*** (Or just 1.6.0) (HscriptPos support).

Follow an FNF source code guide, need help? [Click ME!](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions).

## Coding Instruction's.
* Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)

* Read what Haxelib Plugin's, you need to [install](https://github.com/REALHaydenGaming/based-Engine/blob/main/Project.xml).
  Just read the <haxedef name= />

Then you do your `lime test [Linux, Windows, Mac, your decive your compiling on]`

If you want to code on Window's.... You would need to install 

* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools

* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

### Our Goal's

* Has a brand new input system (Like YoshiCrafter Engine, or OSU!Mania)

* New accuracy & misses (Much like KE'S accuracy)

* Be original as possible

* Lot's more.

### Credit's

* HaydenGaming: Made the engine & some goofy ahhh stuff

* CaptainKirby - Inspritation & that msg he sent me.
